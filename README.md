# Trip Planner: The Personal Travel Assistant

This is a prototype I'm developing right now. Eventually, it's supposed to grow into an all-purpose personal assistant for tourists and people spending a lot of time on the road.

## Getting Started

Basically, the project files are in the /www/ folder - the rest are PhoneGap project files. Getting all of them you can just plug it into PhoneGap and it will run. If you're using PhoneGap Build or a different container, you only need the /www/ folder - it has its own, in-development yet functional config.xml. The /www/build/ folder contains a compiled .apk file for Android. It was built from the same source provided here - minus some later commits perhaps.

### Prerequisites

PhoneGap, Apache Cordova or some other container to turn the HTML5 into a mobile app are preferable, but not entirely necessary. The project has all the necessary library, style and font files attached to it as standalones. No additional files, no dependencies - fully working offline.

### Installing

Convert into a mobile app using PhoneGap or your preferred container. Currently only Android is more or less supported, but it should work on other platforms too. Install the resulting file on your emulator or device - voila.

## Built With
